abstract: Some marine birds and mammals can perform dives of extraordinary duration and depth. Such dive performance is dependent on many factors, including total body oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) stores. For diving penguins, the respiratory system (air sacs and lungs) constitutes 30â€“50% of the total body O<sub>2</sub> store. To better understand the role and mechanism of parabronchial ventilation and O<sub>2</sub> utilization in penguins both on the surface and during the dive, we examined air sac partial pressures of O<sub>2</sub> (_P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>_) in emperor penguins (_Aptenodytes forsteri_) equipped with backpack _P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>_ recorders. Cervical air sac _P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>_ values at rest were lower than in other birds, while the cervical air sac to posterior thoracic air sac _P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>_ difference was larger. Pre-dive cervical air sac _P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>_ values were often greater than those at rest, but had a wide range and were not significantly different from those at rest. The maximum respiratory O<sub>2</sub> store and total body O<sub>2</sub> stores calculated with representative anterior and posterior air sac _P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>_ data did not differ from prior estimates. The mean calculated anterior air sac O<sub>2</sub> depletion rate for dives up to 11 min was approximately one-tenth that of the posterior air sacs. Low cervical air sac _P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>_ values at rest may be secondary to a low ratio of parabronchial ventilation to parabronchial blood O<sub>2</sub> extraction. During dives, overlap of simultaneously recorded cervical and posterior thoracic air sac _P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>_ profiles supported the concept of maintenance of parabronchial ventilation during a dive by air movement through the lungs.
