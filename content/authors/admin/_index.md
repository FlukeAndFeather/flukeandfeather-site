Max Czapanskiy is a PhD candidate in Stanford University's Goldbogen Lab. He uses bio-loggers (animal-borne sensor tags) to merge his passions for natural history and software engineering. His current research is on the ecology and physiology of baleen whales, particularly their cardiorespiratory physiology and energy budgets. Complementing his biological research, he develops computational tools for analyzing, processing, and visualizing ecological big data.
